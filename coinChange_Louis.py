"""
This program solves the problem of making change from a $1 bill when an item costs less than 100 cents.
It calculates how much change is needed by subtracting the itemâ€™s cost from 100. To return the fewest
coins, it uses a greedy approach: starting with the highest coin value (quarters), it figures out how
many of each coin (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies) can be used without going over the remaining amount.
By subtracting each coin's total from the remaining change, it ensures the smallest number of coins is used.
